    <h1>Flamingos</h1>

    <p>Flamingos are large pink or red-colored wading birds known for their long legs. The largest species is the <em>Greater Flamingo</em>, which stands between <strong>4 and 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters)</strong> tall and weighs up to <strong>7.7 pounds (3.5 kilograms)</strong>. The smallest species is the <em>Lesser Flamingo</em>, which stands a little more than <strong>2.5 feet (0.8 m)</strong> tall and weighs about <strong>5.5 pounds (2.5 kg)</strong>. <em>Greater Flamingos</em> have the palest plumage, while <em>Caribbean Flamingos</em> are the brightest pink in color. That distinctive pink color of flamingos comes from the food they eat: algae and shrimp that contain <em>carotenoid pigments</em> (the same stuff that makes carrots orange), and which produce a red pigment when broken down during digestion.</p>
    
    <h2>Socializing</h2>

    <p>Flamingos are social birds and live in groups that can vary in size. They flock together on the ground and when flying.</p>
    
    <h2>Flying</h2>

    <p>Flamingos can fly, but they need to run a few paces before taking off. Their long necks stretch in front of them and their long legs behind when flying.</p>
    
    <h2>Chicks</h2>

    <p>Flamingos breed in pairs, though pairs can change from season to season. The male and female co-operate to build a nest and they lay only one egg per season, which both parents defend. After the chick has hatched both parents are also involved in feeding it. A flamingo nest is essentially a mound of mud <strong>about a foot (0.3 m)</strong> high. The height protects the nest from flood and ground-level heat. When a flamingo chick is born it has grey feathers and a pink beak and legs. They don't take on their characteristic pink color until around age two.</p>
    
    <h2>Weird Flamingo Facts</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>In East Africa, more than one million <em>Lesser Flamingos</em> sometimes flock together, forming the largest flocks of birds known today.</li>
        <li>The <em>Andean Flamingo</em> is the only species with yellow legs.</li>
        <li>Flamingo tongues were highly prized as a delicacy by the ancient Romans, according to the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden. Their eggs are eaten in some parts of the world.</li>
        <li>It isn't really known why flamingos tend to stand on one foot, but it has been hypothesized that keeping one of their feet out of the cold water helps them to conserve body heat. It also seems to be a comfortable resting position for them.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In the wild, flamingos live between <strong>20-30 years</strong>. They can live longer than <strong>30 years</strong> in captivity.</p>
